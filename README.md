# Projects Todo

This project is aimed at creating a TODO program that uses OOP principles and functional programming to properly organize code. This TODO program allows the user to create projects to wrap the TODO lists and assign priority to each item created.

## Usage

- The user can create any TODO item without creating projects, and the TODO is saved to a Default project.
- When new projects are created they can be selected to see the TODOs that belong there.
- Created TODOS can later be edited or deleted.
- If no name is provided for TODOs or projects, the save button is not displayed.
- A border-color helps to show the priority of existing TODOs, it changes when the priority is changed.

## Potential Features

- Replacing localStorage with Firebase.
- Allow the user to edit the TODO in place without a new form popping up.

## Built With

- HTML & CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript/ES6
- localStorage
- Webpack
